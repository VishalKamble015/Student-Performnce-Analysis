# Student Performance Analysis
This is a simple machine learning project using classifiers for predicting factors which affect student grades, using data from CSV file


In this Project, a dataset which has students from nationalities, different grade levels and also soe determining factors like,
number of hands raised, nuber attendances, number of hours studied etc. is used, which is a CSV File.



Features:

Graphical Representation: The program provides insightful graphs that make it easier for users to visualize the distribution of studentsâ€™ marks based on various features like gender, grade, nationality, and more.

Model Evaluation: The code includes various machine learning models, allowing users to compare their performance on the dataset.

Interactivity: The user can select the type of graph they want to visualize and input custom data for prediction.

Data Preprocessing: The code handles data preprocessing by dropping irrelevant columns, label encoding categorical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Multiple Model Options: The program allows users to train and evaluate several machine learning models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Neural Network MLP).

This code represents a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing and classifying student data based on various features. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis through visualizations, training of multiple machine learning models, and the ability to make predictions based on user input.
